[This is a binary file that can't be written as text. I will describe how to create it instead]

To create the star-texture.png file:
1. Create a 64x64 pixel transparent PNG image
2. Draw a white circular gradient that is brightest in the center and fades to transparent at the edges
3. Add a slight glow effect around the edges
4. Save it as star-texture.png in the public directory

Alternatively, you can use an online tool to create a star texture or download a free star texture from a resource website.
